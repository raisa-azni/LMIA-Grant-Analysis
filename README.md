## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handles missing values, standardizes text fields, ensures correct data types, and removes duplicates.
- **Transformation:** Extracts NOC codes and occupation names for precise analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Computes total LMIA approvals, unique positions, and unique employers.
- **Visualizations:** Bar charts for top NOC codes, occupations, employers, and cities.
- **Clean Data Output:** Saves a cleaned CSV for further analysis or reporting.

## How to Run

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

Install dependencies (if needed):

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2. Prepare Data

- Place the raw LMIA CSV file (`tfwp_2024q4_pos_en.csv`) in the `data/` folder.

### 3. Run the Notebook

- Open `LMIA grant analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
- Run all cells sequentially.
- The notebook will:
  - Load and clean the data
  - Extract NOC codes and occupation names
  - Perform descriptive statistics and analysis
  - Generate visualizations
  - Save the cleaned data to `output/lmia_cleaned_2024q4.csv`

## Key Steps in the Notebook

1. **Data Loading:** Reads the raw CSV, handles encoding and header issues.
2. **Cleaning:** Fills missing values, standardizes occupation, employer, and location fields, ensures numeric columns are properly typed, and removes duplicates.
3. **Transformation:** Extracts NOC codes and occupation names into separate columns.
4. **Analysis:** Calculates total approvals, unique positions, and unique employers.
5. **Visualization:** Plots top NOC codes, occupations, employers, and cities.
6. **Output:** Saves the cleaned DataFrame as a CSV for future use.

## Customization

- To analyze a new dataset, replace the CSV in `data/` and rerun the notebook.
- You can modify the notebook to add new analyses or visualizations as needed.
